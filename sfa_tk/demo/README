This directory contains four demo scripts:

- sfatk_demo.m reproduces an example from Wiskott, L. and Sejnowski,
  T.J. (2002), "Slow Feature Analysis: Unsupervised Learning of
  Invariances", Neural Computation, 14(4):715-770, Figure 2 and
  illustrates the basic sfa-tk functions.

- long_dataset_demo.m solves the same problem as sfatk_demo.m. It
  illustrates how to perform SFA on long data sets.

- expansion_demo.m shows how to perform SFA on user-defined function
  spaces. This script uses two functions defined in the subdirectory
  expansion_demo/ .

- getHf_demo.m illustrates how to use the sfa_getHf function.
